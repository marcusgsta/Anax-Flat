Det här är ett [exempel på länk som går till en sida om markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/).

    Genom att indentera texten 4 mellanslag
    eller en tab så får man <pre><code> -
    effekt på texten.
    <body><a href="En länk">En länkadress som inte går att klicka</a>

Vanlig paragraftext ser ut så här. Ett annat typsnitt.

Och så en tabell:

<table style="border-spacing: 4px; border-collapse: separate">
<tr>
<td>#E21F30</td>
<td>#FFFFFF</td>
<td>#C0BAA2</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td style="background-color: #E21F30">
<td style="background-color: #FFFFFF">
<td style="background-color: #C0BAA2">
</tr>
</table>
